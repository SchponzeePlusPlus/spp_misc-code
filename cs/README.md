# README.md

Honestly I forgot what cs stands for, but if I had to make an educated guess, it stands for Computer Scripts, Command Scripts, or Console Scripts, and probably not Computer Science

I think I might rename this directory os_tools: Operating Systems, Tools (for different). Most of the contents in this directory right now are Command Line Interpreter (CL-Intepreter) (Shell) scripts.
