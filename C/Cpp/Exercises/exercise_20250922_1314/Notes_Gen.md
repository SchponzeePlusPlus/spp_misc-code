Things i can do to further clean the code:
- note: do easier stuff first before more significant changes
- any simple unassign functions, like for enums, replace with = 0; when it would be called
- condense the shift...

- Make a vector for list
- vector of a struct, struct which contains char pos and enum to say whether current combo has been calculated
- make a vector for 2 pos buffer
- maybe an i x j (2d) array of counts of combos for each combo

- Things I can do going forward with attempt no. 2:
	- check memory available, especially in functions (stack) and heap usage
	- reduce reliance on large arrays that consume so much memory, rely more on a "real-time" buffer
	- advanced data structures and algorthms, would using them be more efficient (e.g. linked lists)?
	- conform sw dev conventions to make code readable and peer-reviewable, this includes modularity and naming conventions
	- maybe output results to a .csv and/or log file, reduce noise in the console and save results better!
	- Other C++ things I could do for improved quality code?
		- Better memory management? (garbage collection?)

Approach:

- Maybe start out with something quick and easy, like an array of all possible combinations, then filter as needed
- Follow up with a linked-list attempt or some other advanced data structure and algorithm
